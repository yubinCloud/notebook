#### Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection

---
In this paper, we propose Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM), a deep learning framework that addresses the **aforementioned** challenges in unsupervised anomaly detection **from several aspects**.

+ aforementioned	adj.上述的；前面提及的

---

Usually, it is hard to learn deep autoencoders by end-to-end training, **as** they can **be easily stuck in less attractive local optima**, so pre-training **is widely adopted**.

+ be easily stuck in less attractive local optima：陷入不那么吸引人的局部最优状态

---

It is hard to make any significant change to a **well-trained** autoencoder **via fine-tuning**.

---

Given a dataset of N samples, the objective function that guides DAGMM training is constructed as follows.

+ 用于引出这个 model 的 objective function
